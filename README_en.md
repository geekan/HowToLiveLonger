### 1. Glossary

* ACM: All-Cause Mortality

### 2. Objective

* Live longer

### 3. Key Result

* Reduces ACM by 66.67%
* Increase life expectancy by \~20 years
* ~~Keep dopamine at a balanced level~~

### 4. Analysis

* Main reference: There are relatively many academic papers related to ACM, which can be used as the main reference.
* The relationship between lifespan and ACM is nonlinear: Obviously, the relationship between lifespan and ACM is a nonlinear function. Assumption:`DeltaLifeSpan=(1/(1+DeltaACM)-1)*10` (DeltaACM is ACM's change value. Welcome to optimize this formula)
* Variables cannot be simply superimposed: Variables do not meet the IID assumption, and the actual effect between the variables is also unclear.
* Conflicting views: All references have literature/study counterparts, but there are significant conflicting views between some of the literature(e.g. Carbohtdrate intake retio), and some of the literature are controversial(e.g. Sleep before 22:00 increases ACM by 43%)
* Research only shows correlation: Research shows more correlation than causation. Confirm whether the research adequately proves causation. 
  * e.g. A research shows that people with an average of 7000 or more steps per day have a significantly lower ACM rate. However, people with fewer steps may include more long-term patients. If this part of data is not reasonably excluded, the result is distorted.

### 5. Action

* Input
  * Solid: Plain boiled pork(-11%\~-3% ACM), Fruits and vegetables(-26%\~-17% ACM), Spicy food(-23% ACM), Nuts(-27%\~-4% ACM), *less egg yolk(otherwise +7% ACM per 0.5 pieces per day)(controversial)*, moderate carbs, Vegetable protein(-10% ACM), less ultra-processed foods(-62%\~-18%)
  * Liquid: Coffee(-22%\~-12% ACM), Milk(-17%\~-10% ACM), Tea(-15%\~-8% ACM), Limit or avoid sweetened beverages(Otherwise +7% ACM per cup per day, +dopamine), Give up alcohol or less than 100g per week(pure alcohol(g)=alcohol consumption(ml)×Alcohol concentration(%)×(Alcohol density)0.8g/ml)(Otherwise +\~50% ACM, unlimited)
  * Gas: No smoking(Otherwise +~50% ACM, -12\~-11 years lifespan)
  * Illumination: Sunbathe(-~40% ACM)
  * Medicine: Metformin(for diabetic, +3 years lifespan), Multi-vitamins(-8% cancer risk), Spermidine(-60%\~-30% ACM), Glucosamine(-39% ACM)
* Output
  * Sports: 45-minute racquet sports 3 times a week(-47% ACM)
  * Everyday life: Brush your teeth(-25% ACM)
  * Sleep: Sleep 7 hours a day. (fall asleep between 22-24 o'clock) *earlier +43% ACM, later +15% ACM(controversial)*
* Other
  * Weight: Lose weight(-54% ACM)

Conversely, all-cause mortality correlated inversely with sodium intake (β = -131 events/g of daily sodium intake, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.60, P < 0.001). In a sensitivity analysis restricted to 46 countries in the highest income class, sodium intake continued to correlate positively with healthy life expectancy at birth (β = 3.4 years/g of daily sodium intake, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.53, P < 0.001) and inversely with all-cause mortality (β = -168 events/g of daily sodium intake, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.50, P < 0.001).

During follow-up, the hazard ratios for all-cause mortality compared with never smoking were 1.17 (95% CI 1.10-1.25) and 1.54 (1.42-1.67) for <10 cigarettes per day or ≥10 cigarettes per day, respectively. Hazard ratios were similar regardless of age or gender. The diseases most closely associated with daily smoking are respiratory cancers, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and gastrointestinal and vascular diseases. People who quit smoking at the time of recruitment had lower mortality rates than current daily smokers.

  * Adverse reactions
    * As a drug that has been used for nearly a hundred years, the adverse reactions of metformin have been very clear. The common ones are: vitamin B12 deficiency (7%-17.4%), gastrointestinal adverse reactions (up to 53%), fatigue (9%), headache (6%). 
	* Serious but infrequent adverse reactions include lactic acidosis, liver damage.

  * The latest research from West Virginia University found that glucosamine (chondroitin) can reduce cardiovascular mortality by 65% and reduce overall mortality by 39%, which is equivalent to regular exercise.
  * The study used National Health and Nutrition Examination (NHANES) data from 16,686 adults from 1999 to 2010. Participants were followed for a median of 107 months, and 648 of them took 500-1000 mg of glucosamine/chondroitin daily for more than one year on a regular basis.
* Spermidine

  * Spermidine is the most easily absorbed polyamine from the human gut. Spermidine is found in high amounts in many foods, such as fresh green peppers, wheat germ, cauliflower, broccoli, mushrooms and various cheeses, especially in soy products such as natto, shiitake mushrooms and durian. In this experiment, the researchers selected 829 participants aged 45-84 for a 20-year follow-up to analyze the potential association between dietary spermidine intake and human mortality.
  * The study found that women's spermidine intake was higher than men's, and the intake decreased with age. The main sources of spermidine were whole grains (13.4%), apples and pears (13.3%), salads (9.8%), sprouts (7.3%) and potatoes (6.4%). The study divided the population into three groups based on spermidine intake, low intake (<62.2 µmol/d), moderate intake (62.2–79.8 µmol/d), and high intake (>79.8 µmol/d). A total of 341 deaths were recorded during follow-up, including 137 from vascular disease, 94 from cancer, and 110 from other causes. The crude mortality rates for the low, middle, and high groups were calculated to be 40.5%, 23.7%, and 15.1%, respectively. These data indicate a significant inverse relationship between spermidine intake and all-cause mortality. The relationship remained significant with gradual adjustment for age, sex, and calorie ratios.

  * One conclusion is that bedtime is strongly associated with all-cause mortality, and that going to bed too early and going to bed too late can affect health. But going to bed early was associated with higher all-cause mortality than going to bed late, with an increased risk of death by 43 percent and going to bed late by 15 percent.
  * There are still many limitations in this research study. For example, it does not directly prove the relationship between bedtime and death, only shows the correlation, and the data obtained by using the self-reports of the participants to count sleep time are not objective enough.

  * The Life Orientation Test (LOT), containing items for optimism and pessimism, was included in a twin study on health of Australians aged over 50 in 1993–1995. After a mean of 20 years, participants were matched against death information from the Australian National Death Index. 1,068 out of 2,978 participants with useable LOT scores had died. Survival analysis tested for associations between separate optimism and pessimism scores and mortality from any cause, and from cancers, cardiovascular diseases or other known causes. Age-adjusted scores on the pessimism scale were associated with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality (Hazard Ratios per 1 standard deviation unit, 95% confidence intervals and p-values 1.134, 1.065–1.207, 8.85 × 10–5 and 1.196, 1.045–1.368, 0.0093, respectively) but not with cancer deaths. Optimism scores, which were only weakly correlated with pessimism scores (age-adjusted rank correlation = − 0.176), did not show significant associations with overall or cause-specific mortality. Reverse causation (disease causing pessimism) is unlikely because in that case both cardiovascular diseases and cancers would be expected to lead to pessimism.

  * The study used data from wave 1 of the MIDUS study (MIDUS 1), which were collected in 1994 to 1996.  Survival models tested the association between net worth and all-cause mortality. The full sample comprised 5414 participants, who had a mean (SD) age of 46.7 (12.7) years and included 2766 women (51.1%). Higher net worth was associated with lower mortality risk (hazard ratio [HR], 0.95; 95% CI, 0.94-0.97; P<.001). Among siblings and twin pairs specifically (n=2490), a similar within-family association was observed between higher net worth and lower mortality (HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.91-0.97; P=.001), suggesting that the sibling or twin with more wealth tended to live longer than their co-sibling or co-twin with less wealth.

  * Adults who lost weight from obese to overweight by midlife had a 54% lower risk of all-cause mortality (HR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.27-0.77) compared with adults who were stable obese. Adults who lost weight from overweight in early adulthood to normal weight by midlife did not have reduced mortality risk (HR, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.86-1.45).
